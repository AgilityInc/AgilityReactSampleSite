# AgilityReactSampleSite

This is a sample website using [.NET MVC 5](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/mvc5) for the backend, [Agility](https://agilitycms.com) as the CMS, [ReactJS.NET](http://reactjs.net/) as the frontend, [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) as the package manager, and [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) as the module bundler.
